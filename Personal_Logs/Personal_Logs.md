#### First ideas - Really Thinking about what I want to build
When I first got off into the summer break, I had mainly one thing in mind. I knew I wanted to make something that critically examines the role of tactility in the tangibility of a system. I'd been interested in the subject for the past two years and I'd been reading up a lot of material over the third semester (Quick Shout out to Mark Weiser's original [Ubiquitous Computing essay](http://scihi.org/mark-weiser-ubiquituous-computing/), still one of my dearest!). And I also knew I wanted to make something really really cool. In my head, the perfect amalgamation of both these objectives was Iron Man. Robert Downey Jr. muttering to himself as he swishes his hands here and there in a room filled with holograms was ESSENTIALLY cool. And so I started from there.

#### 3D Sculpting - Setting the scope
Knowing I wanted to create something of the sort, I watched Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man - the whole film, and then the suit building scene from Iron Man 2 again and again. It proved to be the perfect way to inspire myself while technically also counting as downtime having just finished the third semester of the MSc. And therein lay my first idea for the thesis - Iron Man was building suits, I could build anything. Having used CAD as an industrial designer for close to 5 years by this point and then new modelling environments such as Unreal and Blender while on the MSc., I was all too familiar with the complaints around it. Navigating a 3D environment in 2D is uneccesarily hard. Sure, I've gotten used to it now, over time, but I've never really enjoyed it. A few too many times in the past as I try to make an edit here or a delete there, I've gone wrong - not because I didn't know how to use the tools but because, I believe, the tools weren't really designed well.  "If I could model anything I wanted just like Tony Stark does with his hands, the whole process would be so much easier. Because it would be a lot more tangible! And more fun too! "     

#### What does it mean for something to be tangible? And tactile?
Before the school was officially on break for the summer, I got an opportunity to sepak with my supervisor Phoenix and the first thing she asked me to do was define what 'tangibility' and 'tactility'. These were terms I'd been throwing around but never really critically examined. I sat down and came up with these definitions - an extension of dictionary defintions based on individual experience:

While traditionally, tangibility is related intrinsically to touch, its definition can be extended to include other sense that one is capable of perceiving. If something is tangible, that means it is comprehensible through some means. Hence, tangibility could be defined as:     
    
**Tangibility**: The perceptibility of an object.    

Tactility, on the other hand, is more grounded in touch. But when Iron Man uses holograms to create his suit, he is not touching any tactile thing at all. He is performing the actions that he would with an otherwise tactile form with with results that match expectations of tactile objects. So tactility can be broken down into two - a subset and a superset. The superset, tactility, can be defined as:    
    
**Tactility**: The capability of an object to be touched.     
     
The subset can be defined as:    
**Tactility**: The capability of an object to behave as though being touched - whether through physical touch or through simulated touch like haptic feedback, etc.
     
## July
### July 01 - July 15 
#### Why 3D Sculpting though??
#### Has anything like this been done before? - Starting the literature review
#### Free Form Deformation - How could I actually make something like this?
#### I need to turn the scope waaaaaaay down - Landscape Sculpting
#### So it's like clay sculpting. Well then, what is clay sculpting?
### July 16 - July 31
#### What's wrong with Blender and Unreal? - Where's the disconnect?
#### The Kinect - What if I let users play around in free space?
#### Do I need to rely only on hands? - 'How Things Shape the Mind: A Theory of Material'
#### First trials with Kinect - This is impossible!!!
## August
### August 01 - August 15 
#### Continued trials with Kinect - Still Impossible!!
#### Looking at more projects and literature - Categorising?
#### There's a whole taxonomy paper in here! - Literature Review
### August 16 - August 31
#### Something with this is off! - It needs to be visualised in 3D as well
#### More literature review - Finding the gap
## September
### September 01 - September 10 
#### Chat with Lieven - Let's put some VR in here, that should do it!
#### Looking at 3D Engines in detail - Unity, Unreal, OpenGL, OpenFrameworks, Processing?
#### Unity is the solution! - But everyone suddenly hates it??
### September 11 - September 20
#### Time I started developing! - Making the VR Rig in Unity
#### Small tangent into Unreal - Won't work
#### I bought the Meta Quest 2 - I hate it!
#### Thesis Editing - What is my argument really? How am I framing it?
#### Hand Presence and Physics - OpenXR vs OVR Toolkit
### September 21 - September 31
#### The Mesh Object!
#### Generating a mesh procedurally
#### Perlin Noise comes in clutch once again
#### Vertex Shading - Universal Render Pipeline!
#### Talking to sculptors - What do they really do?
## October
### October 01 - October 10 
#### Now what if I move my hands just a little bit? - Deforming the mesh little by little
#### And what if I want to move around the world myself?
#### Something's off with the scale!
#### SUCCESS! - I CAN DEFORM THE MESH!
### October 11 - October 20
#### But what are all the ways in which I can deform the mesh? - Designing brushes
#### I don't want the whole thing to move! - Defining brush shapes!
#### How do I show the area of influence?
#### Looks good, but what if someone wants to take it to Blender next - The export system
#### And what if they just want to visualise it? - PNG Exports
#### I can make a lot of brushes, but many don't serve the purpose - Legacy brushes
### October 21 - October 31
#### The brushes still don't seem natural
#### Using the hand's velocity! That's it!
#### Also, visuals are not the only important thing - Haptics and Sound Design
#### Solving performance issues - 25 fps to 65 fps
#### I need to write all of this down lest I forget myself - Documenting the code and writing the paper
## November
### November 01 - November 15
#### Let's take a step back - What am I testing towards?
#### Building the testing framework
#### Making the GUI to have it testing ready
### November 16 - November 24
#### Making a video to show it off
#### Analysing the results from the testing
