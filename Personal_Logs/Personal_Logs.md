### Description

## June
### June 15 - June 30
#### First ideas - Really Thinking about what I want to build
#### What does it mean for something to be tangible?
#### Tactility! - Defining tangibility and tactility for myself
## July
### July 01 - July 15 
#### Why 3D Sculpting though??
#### Has anything like this been done before? - Starting the literature review
#### Free Form Deformation - How could I actually make something like this?
#### I need to turn the scope waaaaaaay down - Landscape Sculpting
#### So it's like clay sculpting. Well then, what is clay sculpting?
### July 16 - July 31
#### What's wrong with Blender and Unreal? - Where's the disconnect?
#### The Kinect - What if I let users play around in free space?
#### Do I need to rely only on hands? - 'How Things Shape the Mind: A Theory of Material'
#### First trials with Kinect - This is impossible!!!
## August
### August 01 - August 15 
#### Continued trials with Kinect - Still Impossible!!
#### Looking at more projects and literature - Categorising?
#### There's a whole taxonomy paper in here! - Literature Review
### August 16 - August 31
#### Something with this is off! - It needs to be visualised in 3D as well
#### More literature review - Finding the gap
## September
### September 01 - September 10 
#### Chat with Lieven - Let's put some VR in here, that should do it!
#### Looking at 3D Engines in detail - Unity, Unreal, OpenGL, OpenFrameworks, Processing?
#### Unity is the solution! - But everyone suddenly hates it??
### September 11 - September 20
#### Time I started developing! - Making the VR Rig in Unity
#### Small tangent into Unreal - Won't work
#### I bought the Meta Quest 2 - I hate it!
#### Thesis Editing - What is my argument really? How am I framing it?
#### Hand Presence and Physics - OpenXR vs OVR Toolkit
### September 21 - September 31
#### The Mesh Object!
#### Generating a mesh procedurally
#### Perlin Noise comes in clutch once again
#### Vertex Shading - Universal Render Pipeline!
#### Talking to sculptors - What do they really do?
## October
### October 01 - October 10 
#### Now what if I move my hands just a little bit? - Deforming the mesh little by little
#### And what if I want to move around the world myself?
#### Something's off with the scale!
#### SUCCESS! - I CAN DEFORM THE MESH!
### October 11 - October 20
#### But what are all the ways in which I can deform the mesh? - Designing brushes
#### I don't want the whole thing to move! - Defining brush shapes!
#### How do I show the area of influence?
#### Looks good, but what if someone wants to take it to Blender next - The export system
#### And what if they just want to visualise it? - PNG Exports
#### I can make a lot of brushes, but many don't serve the purpose - Legacy brushes
### October 21 - October 31
#### The brushes still don't seem natural
#### Using the hand's velocity! That's it!
#### Also, visuals are not the only important thing - Haptics and Sound Design
#### Solving performance issues - 25 fps to 65 fps
#### I need to write all of this down lest I forget myself - Documenting the code and writing the paper
## November
### November 01 - November 15
#### Let's take a step back - What am I testing towards?
#### Building the testing framework
#### Making the GUI to have it testing ready
### November 16 - November 24
#### Making a video to show it off
#### Analysing the results from the testing
