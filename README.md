# TactiScape VR

## Quick Details
**Description:** TactiScape VR is a tool that uses simulated tactility to allow users to model 3D landscapes with their hands and gestures in virtual reality. TactiScape presents a novel Free Form Vertex Displacement (FFVD) technique that allows for real time deformation of large scale meshes using gestures and hand positioning. The accompanying research explores the impact such simulated tactility can have on the experience oif a 3D sculpting system viewed through the lenses of intuitivity, efficiency, immersion, enjoyability, etc.
